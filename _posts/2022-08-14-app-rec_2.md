When you open Phoom, you'll be taken straight to your recent photos. 
From there, you can easily swipe left 👈 or right 👉 to browse through them, or swipe up 👆 to delete any that you no longer need. 
If you want to save a photo, just tap it to add it to a collection. It's that easy!

### Free Version to everyone!
