## Introduction

It's that time again for our quarterly app recommendations! 
This time, I am highlighting a website extension called AdGuard. Let's dive in and check out the biggest announcements and highlights from this year's event.

## AdGuard
> Keywords: Clean üßπ, No more ads üà≤Ô∏è, Secure üîí, and customizable üëã.

### What is it? 

AdGuard is a powerful tool that blocks ads, trackers, and other forms of online spam and clutter. 
With AdGuard installed, you can enjoy a faster, cleaner, and more secure browsing experience.

### Why?  

One of the best things about AdGuard is its customizable filters. You can choose which types of ads and trackers to block, and even create your own custom filters. 
AdGuard also offers a range of pre-made filters, including ones for blocking specific ad networks, adult content, and social media widgets.

In addition to its ad-blocking capabilities, AdGuard also has a built-in privacy protection feature. 
This feature blocks online trackers and other forms of online surveillance, helping you maintain your online privacy and anonymity.

### How to use it?
AdGuard is available for all major web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. 
It's also available for iOS and Android, allowing you to block ads and protect your privacy on your mobile devices as well.

### Test in real life
After testing, we have found that AdGuard has significantly better ad-blocking and privacy protection capabilities than AdBlock. 
In a two-minute YouTube video, AdBlock blocked 8 ads while AdGuard blocked 97 ads. On the homepage of bilibili.com, AdBlock did not block any ads while AdGuard blocked 72 ads.

These results show that AdGuard is a more effective tool for blocking ads and protecting your online privacy. 
Its customizable filters and built-in privacy protection make it a powerful tool for improving your online experience.
